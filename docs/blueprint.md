## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A vibrant blue (#29ABE2), evoking a sense of trust and technological savvy.
- Background color: Light-grey (#F0F2F5), providing a clean and modern backdrop that doesn't distract from the video content. Suitable for a light mode scheme.
- Accent color: A lively orange (#FF9933), for interactive elements and calls to action; it is analogous to the primary and different enough in brightness.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headings and short text snippets, combined with 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text and longer descriptions, enhancing readability.
- Clean, minimalist icons for download actions, sharing options, and language selection. Should be easily understandable at a glance.
- Responsive design with clear content hierarchy. Mobile-first approach to ensure optimal experience on smaller screens. Use of grid and flexbox for flexible and adaptive layouts.
- Subtle, unobtrusive animations for loading states and transitions to improve perceived performance and user engagement. E.g. skeleton loaders and fade-in effects.
